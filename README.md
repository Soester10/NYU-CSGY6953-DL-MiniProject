**Abstract**: <br>
CIFAR-10 is a benchmark dataset used for image classification tasks in machine learning and computer vision. Micro ResNet 1 is a reduced version of ResNet 18, with fewer trainable parameters. Multiple hyperparameter sweeps using different optimizers, learning rates, momentum, and weight decay were performed to find the best combination for the model. The results obtained with the best combination of hyperparameters were a training accuracy of 98.69% and a testing accuracy of 90.89% after running for 100 epochs.
